# Table: index - Query Chaos Indexes using SQL

Chaos is a service within OCI that allows you to conduct chaos experiments on your infrastructure to test its resilience. It provides a way to simulate different kinds of failures and observe their impact. Chaos helps you understand the weaknesses of your system and take appropriate actions to improve its resilience.

## Table Usage Guide

The `index` table provides insights into chaos experiment results within OCI Chaos. As a resilience engineer, explore experiment-specific details through this table, including experiment name, status, and impact. Utilize it to uncover information about experiments, such as those causing significant impact, the resilience of different components, and the verification of system robustness.
